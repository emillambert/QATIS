## ⚠️ Why UI Shows "Stuck"

The issue is **Streamlit hasn't reloaded** the new error-handling code:

1. Old code: waits indefinitely for process to complete
2. New code: 5-minute timeout + proper completion detection
3. **Solution**: Restart Streamlit to load new code

---

## 🔧 How to Fix (DO THIS NOW)

### Step 1: Stop Streamlit
In the terminal where Streamlit is running:
```
Press Ctrl+C
```

### Step 2: Restart with new code
```bash
cd /Users/emilwl/Documents/QATIS
./start_ui.sh
```

### Step 3: Test with YouTube ONLY
In the UI:
1. **Engines & Platforms**: Select ONLY `youtube` (uncheck reddit, vk, x)
2. **Social Queries**:
   ```yaml
   youtube:
     queries:
       - 'Moldova energy 2024'
   ```
3. Click **Run Collection**
4. Watch it complete properly! 🎉

## 📊 What You Should See After Restart

**Before (stuck):**
```
Collecting social results... (~0s remaining)
[never completes]
```

**After (with new code):**
```
Collecting social results... (~4s remaining)
[completes]

Wrote 1 query files under search_results_social/TIMESTAMP

✅ Social results dir: search_results_social/TIMESTAMP
```

Then you can:
- Click "Export Social CSV"
- Click "Merge Web + Social CSV"
- Analyze the combined dataset

## 🎯 Recommended Configuration (For Now)

**Working platforms:**
- ✅ `web` (Google)
- ✅ `scholar` (Google Scholar)
- ✅ `youtube` (with transcripts)

**Skip for now (until credentials configured):**
- ⏸️ `reddit` (needs Reddit API credentials in UI)
- ⏸️ `vk` (needs testing)
- ❌ `x` (Twitter blocks automated scraping)

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Restart Streamlit** (Ctrl+C, then `./start_ui.sh`)
2. **Test YouTube only** (proven to work)
3. **Export and merge** the results
4. **Analyze** with AI
5. **Download** the bundle

Once that works, we can add Reddit credentials and test VK.

## 💡 Pro Tip: Why YouTube is Enough

YouTube videos about Moldova infrastructure often include:
- ✅ Transcripts with detailed technical info
- ✅ Expert interviews and analysis
- ✅ Visual evidence of infrastructure state
- ✅ Recent news and developments

Combined with web/scholar, you get comprehensive OSINT coverage without needing all social platforms.

2. Create an app (script type)
3. Copy Client ID and Secret
4. Paste in UI sidebar
5. Click "Save Keys"
6. Enable `reddit` in Engines & Platforms
